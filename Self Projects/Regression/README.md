# Projects
I wanted to about my project on "Regression Analysis" 
which was a great course in my #Computer_and_Data_science_Alexandria_university
Firstly, About the project:- 
Simple Linear Regression (SLR):
SLR involves only one independent variable and one dependent variable.
The relationship between the variables is assumed to be linear.
The equation of the regression line is of the form Y = β₀ + β₁X, where Y is the dependent variable, X is the independent variable, β₀ is the intercept, and β₁ is the slope.
SLR aims to find the best-fitting line that minimizes the sum of squared errors between the observed and predicted values of the dependent variable, useful when there is a single independent variable that is believed to have a linear relationship with the dependent variable.

Multiple Linear Regression (MLR):
MLR involves two or more independent variables and one dependent variable.
The equation of the regression line is of the form Y = β₀ + β₁X₁ + β₂X₂ + ... + βₖXₖ, where Y is the dependent variable, X₁, X₂, ..., Xₖ is the independent variables, β₀ is the intercept, and β₁, β₂, ..., βₖ are the slopes for each independent variable.
MLR is useful when multiple independent variables are believed to have a linear relationship with the dependent variable and when there may be interactions or correlations between the independent variables.

2- What makes this project impressive?:

     ► Printing all needed summary statistics 

     ► Testing if there exists regression for this data or not

     ► making confidence intervals for each beta of independent variables

     ► using Partial-F-Test way to make a test on each independent variable to check if we can get rid of any one of them under the definition of "dimensionality reduction" 

     ► Constructing beautiful plots for the used data
